    `Owning the land will give you a portion of the proceeds generated by user gameplay in your land.` ,
      
    `For example, if you own a settlement and someone visits your tavern to mint a hero, you'll be paid a portion of that mint cost. If a group of heroes pay for entry into your dungeon in hopes to mint some rare loot, you'll receive a portion of the entry fee.`,
      
    `There will be several types of land and some land will require much more upkeep than others. All can be upgraded, cultivated, etc given enough work.`,
      
    `Land ownership will give a new layer of gameplay which will help you develop your heroes and tip the scales in dynasties warfare.  Somebody will reveal Ebisu's Bay the very settlement new players will start the game and where you access the game today.`,
      
    `Soon we'll release a more detailed roadmap and outline. We have a lot of exciting things planned!`]
