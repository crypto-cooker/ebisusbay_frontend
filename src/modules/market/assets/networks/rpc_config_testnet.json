Works often influenced by the events from his personal life or day-to-day reflections about the world around him.",
      "description": "This 6 piece collection was created with an intention to admire certain elements important to the creative process, but also life in general. The aim of every one of these six artworks is to make the new owner just take a small break and ponder about one of those topics, as well as admire their influence on the surrounding world. I chose the form factor of a surreal museum-like space, because ever since I was a small child, I thought about modern art galleries as the calm, quiet places designed to let the observer admire and reflect upon the odd, non-conventional and often controversial concepts. I hope that events taking place in this little space I designed in my head will succeed in their goal.",

Growing up I self-taught to become an equestrian rider. I have also judged equestrian events and competitions and organized charity festivals in support of children with disabilities. \n\nRiding horses can be very healing for children and their psycho-emotional state and for those who become more involved, assists with muscle development. I used to coach children for free but have retired from this. However, I keep in close contact with the equestrian club in my hometown and occasionally still assist by running the group classes for children. I also financially support and support them with media coverage, assisting with fund raising to help kids receive this amazing and free therapy with horses.\n\nTo support the equestrian club and children, I am auctioning a limited-edition 1:1 \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcRare Heart Hodler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 NFT. It also comes with a T-shirt and an autographed card from myself. Additionally, 10 holders of the 'Heart Hodler' from the open edition will be randomly selected to receive a physical autographed card from myself",

With this feature, we will be able to start a unique reward system for our community, in which they can win Cro rewards and points on a leaderboard thought fights in the arena. For this, each CroHamster has Attack and Defense combat stats that indicate how strong it is in fights against other CroHamsters. Additionally, if the CroHamster owns a weapon, it will get an attack bonus. To prevent stale and predictable fights, we will also use a random generated \"Luck\" and \"Hit Percentage\" value.\n\nEvery Crohamster who wants to take part in the arena fights can put their name on a list, two random CroHamsters from different factions are then selected from this list to fight against each other. The winner will then receive the mint price of a CroHamster NFT in Cro as prize (325Cro). They will also earn points on a leaderboard, allowing us to honor the best CroHamster fighters in a Hall of Fame, which qualifies them for additional Hall of Fame giveaways with unique NFT and CRO rewards.",

In order to be entered into the WenLambo giveaway, you must get lucky and mint 1 of 500 Trashcans that wear the Golden Key Earring! But that\u2019s not all! A handful of our 162 different traits grants you access to numerous giveaways such as PS5\u2019s, Xbox\u2019s, Oculus, cash prizes and more. Owning a TTC NFT gives you exclusive access to any events we may hold in the future! Another one of our missions is to promote a cleaner environment, so when you see a TTC NFT we hope it reminds you to do your part and trash or recycle in the proper receptacles. We will also be donating a large sum to a non-profit organization who shares the mission in keeping our earth as clean as possible!!! If you get lucky enough to mint a golden key, we\u2019d like you to remember that keys open doors and it\u2019d be a bummer for you to lose your keys...",

The club provides distinction, profitability, and functionality, from an original NFT clothing brand to a Dapp that generates passive income to the holders.\nThe artwork is based on nice and personalized planets, which have different attributes, such as: mouths, eyes, rings, accessories, backgrounds, and more... At the same time, these attributes have many variations, allowing to generate a lot of crazy variations of planets.\nOur roadmap is composed of 7 different stages: The Big Bang (Algorithmic generation of Meta Planet), The Expansion (Marketing and community grow stage), The Arriving (Drop day), Moonland Distribution (For holders), Clothing Brand Creation (Online Shop), Metaverse (Sandbox), My System App (Dapp for holders only).\nAfter the Drop, those lucky ones who have got the \"Certificated Moon\" attribute on their planet, will be able to claim a real moon land, which will be 1 hectare, and the title will be in the name of the NFT owner.\nMore info on our website www.metaplanetclub.com",

If you hold 10x BOB Headz, you can play 10 times per 24H and so on... The more Headz you own, the better chance to get better score. There also will be burn mechanism - part of secondary sale royalties we will use to sweep BOB Headz floor and burn them. This way we will reduce total supply from time to time. So this collection will be more and more valuable in the future. LEGENDARY BOB HEADz In our collection you can find 20 1/1 Legendaries and if you mint one of them, you can claim their bounty!",
