The aim of every one of these six artworks is to make the new owner just take a small break and ponder about one of those topics, as well as admire their influence on the surrounding world. I chose the form factor of a surreal museum-like space, because ever since I was a small child, I thought about modern art galleries as the calm, quiet places designed to let the observer admire and reflect upon the odd, non-conventional and often controversial concepts. I hope that events taking place in this little space I designed in my head will succeed in their goal.",

Growing up I self-taught to become an equestrian rider. I have also judged equestrian events and competitions and organized charity festivals in support of children with disabilities. \n\nRiding horses can be very healing for children and their psycho-emotional state and for those who become more involved, assists with muscle development. I used to coach children for free but have retired from this. However, I keep in close contact with the equestrian club in my hometown and occasionally still assist by running the group classes for children. I also financially support and support them with media coverage, assisting with fund raising to help kids receive this amazing and free therapy with horses.\n\nTo support the equestrian club and children, I am auctioning a limited-edition 1:1 Ã¢â‚¬ËœRare Heart HodlerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ NFT. It also comes with a T-shirt and an autographed card from myself. Additionally, 10 holders of the 'Heart Hodler' from the open edition will be randomly selected to receive a physical autographed card from myself",

Each Lazy Horse NFT grants access to the metaverse clubhouse and Lazy Horse Racing Game (drops end of January!), it also connects you to our real racing team. The Club owns, maintains and races horses with profits being shared by the community. All of the club's efforts are most importantly focused on providing a long and sustainable post-racing life for all horses. A large portion of all project proceeds will directly fund equine rescue and retirement, ensuring great lives for these beautiful animals.",

The location of these mines are a well-kept secret by the Crognomes...\n\nWhile they're no tattletales, the Crognomes might share the secret location of these Cryptomines with you, if you provide them safe refuge in your cryptowallet.\n\nCrognomes have been known to sneak in their wives, the Crognomides, when they're feeling lonely. If you mint a route to your wallet after the minting fase of the Crognomes, you can expect these Crognomides to show up in your wallet as well! When you leave them alone for a long enough time, you will find your family of 2 has grown ever larger.\n\nStart your own Crognome-family and adopt your Crognome today!",

    "description": "The news around the block: Do you remember the days of collecting and trading cards and vinyl seemed like the coolest thing to do? Today, those coveted collectibles have been widely replaced by NFTs.\n\nWe offer the ability to utilize an IRL value trading and gamification aspect to build a collection and “level up” from the airdrop “EB-NFT™” Card, to a virtual airline ticket.\n\nEach holder's goal will be to collect one of each of the characters a total of 7 by the end of the minting process. Missing characters in your collection may be acquired only through secondary to fulfill your collection. \n\nA snapshot will be taken 4-6 weeks post mint out of the 3500 piece collection. \n\nAdditional attributes and 7 character gamification will be revealed prior to Mint day .. Stay Tuned!!! 💎💎**Assets and characters or VIP from other Ghetto-Doves™ collections do not apply in the 7 character collection.",

Colloquially known as “The Squad”, these super villainous bandits are one of the most dangerous groups the galaxy has ever seen. In a universe where 90% of the life forms are built and operated by a company called the Stargen Omega Industries (S.O.I.), “The Squad” stand apart as the last hope for freedom for the galaxy.

For this, each CroHamster has Attack and Defense combat stats that indicate how strong it is in fights against other CroHamsters. Additionally, if the CroHamster owns a weapon, it will get an attack bonus. To prevent stale and predictable fights, we will also use a random generated \"Luck\" and \"Hit Percentage\" value.\n\nEvery Crohamster who wants to take part in the arena fights can put their name on a list, two random CroHamsters from different factions are then selected from this list to fight against each other. The winner will then receive the mint price of a CroHamster NFT in Cro as prize (325Cro). They will also earn points on a leaderboard, allowing us to honor the best CroHamster fighters in a Hall of Fame, which qualifies them for additional Hall of Fame giveaways with unique NFT and CRO rewards.",

A handful of our 162 different traits grants you access to numerous giveaways such as PS5's, Xbox's, Oculus, cash prizes and more. Owning a TTC NFT gives you exclusive access to any events we may hold in the future! Another one of our missions is to promote a cleaner environment, so when you see a TTC NFT we hope it reminds you to do your part and trash or recycle in the proper receptacles. We will also be donating a large sum to a non-profit organization who shares the mission in keeping our earth as clean as possible!!! If you get lucky enough to mint a golden key, we'd like you to remember that keys open doors and it'd be a bummer for you to lose your keys...",

By creating a robust and scalable project, COOM seeks to profit from NFT project presales, taking a percentage fee from the profits and then redistributing a certain percentage of that as passive income to holders weekly. The more Coom Cats NFTs you hold, the greater your passive income potential. Future aspirations for the platform include cross-chain capabilities.\n\nStep 2 - Coom Club:\n\nBenefits of joining the Investor's Club:\n\nRegular Updates on Our Activities: Keeping club members informed about CoomLabs' latest news.\n\nEarly Glimpses of Our Future Features: Sneak peeks of upcoming features, with detailed information provided in advance to club members.\n\nExclusive COOMLABS Industry Offers: Club members can enjoy preferential rates on exclusive merchandising as well as future subscriptions. This offer is reserved exclusively for Investor's Club members for private use.\n\nDedicated Online Private Space: Access a private area where you can interact with other club members.\n\nStep 3 - CoomLabs:\nMore information to come.\n\nStep 4 - COOM Platform:\nCurrently confidential.\n\nEach of our utilities addresses the growing demands of the ecosystem.

Our first-generation NFTs shattered sellout records, and our empire has only expanded since then. Loyal holders of our first-generation NFTs have seen substantial returns on their investments. At the peak, the assets distributed to our holders, such as the $STUCK token airdrop, were more valuable than the initial mint price, offering significant profits.  The FMG has grown to over 5,000 strong holders, forming alliances with blue-chip projects and major marketplaces like Ebisu's Bay. Our influence even extends to the world of DeFi, with our memecoin listed on Crypto.com DeFi Wallet and other top exchanges. \n\nArt at the Forefront, While Fury Mouse Gang has consistently delivered some of the most sought-after NFTs in the ecosystem, art remains the number one priority with \"Free The Gang.\" We're pushing the boundaries of what NFT art can be, offering a stunning visual upgrade that sets this collection apart. Ensuring that this collection is not just an investment but also a masterpiece to be cherished.  But \"Free The Gang\" isn't just about owning a piece of digital art—it's about being part of something bigger.\n\nHere's what’s in store:  DAO-Driven Decisions: 25% of all profits will go directly into a DAO wallet, giving the Gang full control over how this money is used. zkCRO/STUCK LP Development: Another 25% will be invested in creating zkCRO/STUCK liquidity pools on-chain and further developing the $STUCK memecoin. Staking for Rewards: The new generation of NFTs can be staked to earn $STUCK tokens, sourced from the team wallet. Royalties for Holders: 75% of secondary market royalties will be redistributed",
